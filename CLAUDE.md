# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

`citrus` extracts structured information about **French company restructurings** from BODACC
legal announcements (opendatasoft `annonces-commerciales` dataset): *which* of eight canonical
operation types an announcement is (`VE`, `FU`, `AB`, `TP`, `SP`, `AP`, `ST`, `LG`), and the
business fields it carries — above all the SIREN of the transferor (*cédant*) and of the
beneficiary.

The two halves have different coverage, and are **not yet wired together**:

- **Classification** (`src/routing`) handles all eight types.
- **Extraction** (`src/operation`) has skills for `VE`, `LG` and `TP` only; nothing extracts
  fields for the fusion family (`FU`, `AB`, `SP`, `AP`, `ST`).
- No code path runs router → skill end to end. `oracle_benchmark` selects the skill from the
  *annotated* `type_op`, and the routing benchmarks run classification without extraction; tests
  assert this separation (e.g.
  `RoutingTest.test_router_has_no_operation_skill_dependency_or_dispatch` in `tests/test_routing.py`).

Note: `README.md` predates the routing/benchmark layer. It still calls classification
unimplemented and lists `TP`/`LG` among the missing parsers; both are outdated. `main.py` is the
legacy `VE`-only S3 path and touches neither `src/routing` nor `src/operation` — the current
entry points are the four `src/modele/*_benchmark.py` runners.

## Commands

Dependencies are managed with `uv` (Python ≥ 3.13):

```bash
uv sync
```

Tests are plain `unittest` (no pytest), fully offline — LLM calls and BODACC fetches are
injected fakes:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .        # whole suite (~220 tests, seconds)
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_routing            # one module
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_routing.RoutingTest.test_name  # one test
```

No linter, formatter or type checker is configured (none in `pyproject.toml`, no pre-commit).

Benchmarks are the real-data entry points; each takes an annotations CSV/Parquet and an output
directory, and hits both the BODACC API and the LLM lab:

```bash
uv run python -m src.modele.routing_benchmark --annotations <file> --output-dir <dir> [--max-per-type 10|all]
uv run python -m src.modele.fusion_subtype_benchmark --annotations <file> --output-dir <dir> [--max-per-type 5|all]
uv run python -m src.modele.fusion_reconciliation_benchmark --annotations <file> --output-dir <dir> [--max-seeds 5 | --all]
uv run python -m src.modele.oracle_benchmark --annotations <file> --output-dir <dir> [--max-ve N] [--max-lg N] [--max-tp N] [--amount-tolerance 0.1]
```

The "bourrin" approach — one generic prompt, one LLM call doing routing *and* extraction:

```bash
uv run python bourrin.py                      # interactive session
uv run python bourrin.py A20230147853         # one-shot
uv run python bourrin.py A20230147853 --json  # normalized envelope only, for piping
uv run python bourrin.py A20230147853 --no-annotations  # skip loading annotations (offline, faster)
```

By default `bourrin.py` loads annotations from `s3://projet-citrus/data/operations_verifiees.parquet`
(override with `--annotations`); `--json` also skips that load. `--temperature` is forwarded to
the LLM. `bourrin.py` has no dedicated unit tests; it is exercised only indirectly through
`tests/test_explorer_batch.py`.

Batch evaluation of the bourrin approach on annotated operations:

```bash
uv run python explorer_batch.py                             # 20 random operations
uv run python explorer_batch.py --types VE LG -n 50         # filter on annotated type_op
uv run python explorer_batch.py --types FUSION --per-type -n 5   # FUSION = FU AB SP AP ST
uv run python explorer_batch.py --types TP --all            # no sampling
uv run python explorer_batch.py --load artifacts/bourrin_batch/<timestamp>  # reopen, no LLM call
```

It samples annotation *rows* (seeded, stable order), runs `run_bourrin` over a thread pool
(`--workers`, default 4), appends each record to `artifacts/bourrin_batch/<timestamp>/results.jsonl`
as it arrives (gitignored; Ctrl-C keeps partial results), then prints metrics and opens a
`batch>` browsing session (`--no-browse` to skip). Reference rows are stored already normalized
via `_reference_value` under their annotation column names, so bourrin's `_pair_operations` /
`format_comparison` work unchanged on reloaded batches. Metrics compare the `reglesMetier`
reading; field accuracy is computed on predicted/annotated operation pairs only.

`explorer.py` holds the `# %%` cells for driving those functions from a VS Code interactive
window. Importing `bourrin.py` runs nothing except a REPL convenience: it `chdir`s into
`citrus-ia-gen/` if launched from the parent directory. `test.py` is a stale scratch script
(hardcoded `chdir` to a `citrus/` path that no longer exists) — not part of the test suite.

Legacy S3-backed vente evaluation (reads/writes `s3://projet-citrus/...`):

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Call graph regeneration: `bash docs/graphs.sh` (code2flow → `docs/call_graph_all_but_test.png`).
Despite the name, the script excludes `./src/test/*`, which does not exist, so `tests/` is
included in the graph.

## Configuration

`.env` at the repo root is loaded on `import src`. `LLM_LAB_API_KEY` is required for anything
touching an LLM; `LLM_LAB_ENDPOINT` (default `https://llm.lab.sspcloud.fr/api`) and
`LLM_MODEL_NAME` (default `gemma4-26b-moe`) override the SSP Cloud lab defaults. Beware that
the endpoint path is case-sensitive (`/api`, not `/API`) and that a wrong one surfaces as an
opaque `405 Method Not Allowed`. Langfuse is optional: `get_client` only wraps with
`langfuse.openai.OpenAI` when both `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` are set. S3/MinIO access uses the AWS profile
`service-account`. Importing `src` also creates `log/` and opens `log/<timestamp>_citrus.log`.

## Architecture

The pipeline is layered so that each boundary can be tested and benchmarked alone.

**1. Source normalization — `src/bodacc/`**
`api.py` has two generations side by side: legacy `bodacc_api.get_annonce_json` (returns the
first result, no error typing) and the evaluation-oriented `fetch_annonce_json`, which raises
categorized `BodaccFetchError`s. `normalization.py` turns a raw payload into a frozen
`NormalizedBodaccAnnouncement` exposing **source facts only** — dialect (`RCS-A`/`RCS-B`),
parties, descriptions, dates, origin-of-funds. It performs no role inference, no date cascade,
no amount normalization; that separation is deliberate and should be preserved.

**2. Semantic routing — `src/routing/`**
Two stages, both LLM-backed, both returning validated frozen dataclasses:

- `router.py` (`family_router`) picks a coarse `RoutingFamily`: `VE`, `LG`, `TP`,
  `FUSION_FAMILY` or `UNKNOWN`. `build_routing_context` projects the normalized announcement
  into a compact deterministic JSON context (dates deliberately excluded).
- The fusion family then has two alternative paths:
  - `fusion_subtype.py` — single-shot LLM router straight to `FU`/`AB`/`SP`/`ST`/`AP`, plus
    inspectable axes (transfer scope, transferor fate, beneficiary creation/count).
  - `fusion_semantics.py` + `fusion_reconciliation.py` — the two-phase design. The LLM parses
    one announcement into source-grounded participants and a `LegalFamily`; then
    `build_fusion_provisional` produces a provisional record using internal states `FZ`/`SZ`,
    and `reconcile_fusion_family` runs a **pure, offline, campaign-global** pass that resolves
    them (an `AB` anchor propagates to `FZ` rows sharing a beneficiary SIREN; `SP` anchors
    propagate through transferor SIRENs unless local facts conflict). Rows are grouped via
    `description_fingerprint` (NFKC + whitespace canonicalization + SHA-256).

Prompts live in dedicated `*_prompt.py` modules, are written in French, demand a single JSON
object, and each carries a version constant (`ROUTER_PROMPT_VERSION`,
`FUSION_SUBTYPE_PROMPT_VERSION`, `FUSION_SEMANTICS_PROMPT_VERSION`, …) alongside taxonomy
versions. Bump these when you change a prompt or a label set — benchmark summaries record them.

**3. Extraction skills — `src/operation/`**
"Skill" here is this repo's own vocabulary for a per-operation-type extraction unit — a plain
`Protocol` implementation, unrelated to agentic Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`), tool calling or any
agent loop, none of which exist in this codebase. Each skill implements the `OperationSkill`
protocol (`operation_type` + `extract(announcement)
-> OperationResult`, a fixed `TypedDict` of Citrus business fields). `vente.py` mixes structured
JSON reads with LLM extraction for free-text amount/date; `transmission_patrimoine.py` and
`location_gerance.py` are deterministic (regex/date parsing over normalized facts).

**Alternative: the "bourrin" approach — `bourrin.py`**
A deliberate counter-experiment to layers 2 and 3: `run_bourrin` sends the raw (dict-expanded)
BODACC payload to a single LLM call with one generic French prompt that asks for the operation
type *and* every business field at once.

The prompt (`bourrin_prompt.md` at the repo root, read verbatim into `SYSTEM_PROMPT`; version `BOURRIN_PROMPT_VERSION`) merges two sources: the **business rules** the
operators actually apply — the ordered cascade LG → TP → fusion/scission ≤2 → >2 → VE →
not retained, the textual anchors for dates and amounts, one operation per secondary SIREN —
and the **legal definitions** of the eight types. The model returns *two independent readings*
of the same announcement: `reglesMetier` (compared against the annotations, since that process
produced them) and `lectureJuridique` (its own legal reading), plus a free-text `analyse`.
Each reading carries a **list** of operations, matching the per-operation granularity of the
annotation file.

Determinism lives in Python, not in the model: `normalize_answer` coerces the free-form answer
(SIREN zero-padding + Luhn warning, several date formats → ISO, unknown type → `UNKNOWN`), and
the amount is asked in EUR then converted to the kEUR contract via `_eur_to_integer_keur`.
`format_comparison` pairs predicted operations with annotated rows on the (cédant, bénéficiaire)
couple before falling back to order. `fetch`/`ask_fn` are injectable, as elsewhere.

Note `_expand_payload`: `bourrin.py` deliberately does **not** use `src.bodacc.api._clean_json`,
which tests a hardcoded key and passes `None` to `json.loads` — it raises on 7 of the 8
operation types, only vente payloads survive it. Do not reuse `_clean_json` outside the vente
path.

**4. Evaluation — `src/modele/`**
`benchmark.py` is the pure offline comparator: it normalizes annotations and predictions and
compares them field by field on `JOIN_KEY = "ref_annonce_complet"`. `bodacc_lookup.py` derives
the exact BODACC OpenData id from annotation references and refuses to synthesize one when
anything is ambiguous. The four runners wire fetch → route/extract → compare, write Parquet
predictions/errors plus a `*_summary.json` (model name, prompt/taxonomy versions, git HEAD),
and select deterministic sub-samples in stable id order. `evaluate.py` + `metrics.py` are the
older polars/S3 vente path used by `main.py`.

Annotation files are expected to carry `ref_annonce`, `numero_annonce`, `ref_annonce_complet`,
`type_op`, `siren_cedante`, `siren_beneficiaire`, `date_effet_comptable_op`,
`date_realisation_juridique_op`, `montant`.

## Conventions that matter here

- **Never invent a classification.** `UNKNOWN` is a first-class outcome at every routing stage;
  ambiguous announcements must not fall back to `VE`. `fusion_reconciliation` documents a
  historical `FU`/`ST` → `AP` fallback it explicitly does *not* implement
  (`HISTORICAL_ISOLATED_AP_FALLBACK_IMPLEMENTED = False`) rather than guess.
- **Reference labels stay out of the pipeline.** `type_op` is used only to build cohorts or as a
  declared oracle (`oracle_benchmark`), and is joined back after prediction.
- **Strict LLM output validation.** Every router parses JSON strictly (duplicate keys rejected,
  evidence/reason length-capped) and raises typed `*LLMError` / `*OutputError` subclasses instead
  of coercing a bad answer.
- **Dependency injection over patching internals.** Routers and benchmark runners accept `ask`
  functions, fetchers and skill maps as parameters — that is what keeps the whole suite offline.
- **Two code styles coexist.** Newer modules (`bodacc/normalization`, `routing/*`, `operation/*`,
  `modele/*benchmark*`) use `from __future__ import annotations`, frozen `slots=True` dataclasses,
  `str`-valued `Enum`s and exhaustive docstrings; legacy modules (`bodacc/api`, `operation/vente`
  helpers, `modele/evaluate`, `modele/metrics`, `main.py`, `test.py`) are looser. Match the style
  of the module you are editing rather than the repo average.
